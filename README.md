# House-Price-Prediction-Analysis
This repository contains the materials and codes for the course project. The main goal of this project is to clean, analyze, and model a dataset of housing prices. The analysis is done in R and the codes are presented in an R Notebook..

## Dataset
The dataset house-analysis.RDa contains information about various houses, including their prices, sizes, numbers of rooms and bathrooms, and several other features.

## Repository Contents
The repository contains the following files:

1. **README.md** - This file, explaining the contents of the repository.
2. **House-analysis.RDa** - The dataset used for the analysis.
3. **House-Price-Prediction-Analysis.Rmd** - R Notebook containing the analysis code.

## Project Description
  The project is divided into four main sections:

1. **Organise and clean the data**: In this part, the data is loaded, subsetted according to student ID, and thoroughly checked for quality issues. Any issues found are then addressed and corrected.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Here, the data is explored through various statistics and visualizations to understand the relationships between different variables.

3. **Modelling**: Based on the EDA results, a linear regression model is created to predict house prices. The model is then evaluated for its goodness of fit and potential improvements.

4. **Extension work**: As an additional task, a logistic regression model is built to predict the likelihood of a house being furnished.

## How to Run the Code
  To run the code, clone the repository and open House-Price-Prediction-Analysis.Rmd in RStudio. Ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed. If not, you can install them using the install.packages() function in R.
